# DishDash - Your Food Inventory and Recipe Management Phone App 

Have you ever opened the fridge stocked with all the food ingredients but had no idea what to cook? Do your food items often expire before you find a way to cook them? Fridge Buddy is here to rescue! It's an app designed to log all your food ingredients and recipes, helping you figure out what you can cook with the ingredients you have at hand.
